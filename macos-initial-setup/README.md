# macOS Initial Setup

> Opinionated, idempotent shell scripts for provisioning and maintaining
> a macOS workstation.

This folder is the macOS setup package inside the broader helper-scripts
repository. It turns the normal "fresh Mac checklist" — install apps, wire
up language toolchains, keep caches and Homebrew under control — into a set
of small, composable scripts that are safe to run today, next month, and on
the next machine. Every change is previewable with `--dry-run`, logged to
`$TMPDIR`, and opt-out at a per-feature level.

**Platform:** macOS 12+ (Monterey through the current release) on Apple
Silicon and Intel. **Shell:** `bash` for scripts (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`),
`zsh` for the aliases file.

## TL;DR

For returning users. Every command is idempotent.

```bash
# First run on a new machine
./install_apps.sh                        # cask apps + DevOps CLIs + Google Cloud SDK
./install_devtools.sh --setup-shell      # Python, Terraform, Go, Helm

# Regular maintenance (weekly is a good cadence)
./stay_fresh.sh                          # purge, cleanup, upgrade, report
./stay_fresh.sh --dry-run                # preview without changes

# One-off previews
./install_apps.sh     --dry-run --verbose
./install_devtools.sh --dry-run --verbose
```

After linking `zsh_aliases.zsh`, the same three are available as
`install-apps`, `install-devtools`, and `stay-fresh`.

## Folder map

| File | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `install_apps.sh` | Day-one workstation apps, Homebrew casks/formulae, platform CLIs, and Google Cloud SDK. |
| `install_devtools.sh` | Language and infrastructure toolchains: Python, Terraform, Go, Helm, and version managers. |
| `stay_fresh.sh` | Recurring maintenance: cleanup, updates, cache pruning, and version reporting. |
| `v1_stay_fresh.sh` | Legacy minimal maintenance flow kept for reference and simple one-off runs. |
| `zsh_aliases.zsh` | Optional interactive-shell aliases and helper functions. |

## Lifecycle: when to run what

The repository is organized around the life of a workstation. Each
script fills a distinct slot — understanding which slot matters more
than memorizing flags.

| Phase | Script | Typical cadence | What it touches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bootstrap** | `install_apps.sh` | Once per machine | `/Applications`, Homebrew Cask + formulae (e.g. `k9s`, `awscli`), Google Cloud SDK |
| **Bootstrap** | `install_devtools.sh` | Once per machine (+ version bumps) | `~/.pyenv`, `~/.goenv`, `$(brew --prefix)/bin`, optionally `~/.zshrc` |
| **Ambient** | `zsh_aliases.zsh` | Sourced on every interactive shell (after wiring into `~/.zshrc`) | Your shell only — no disk writes |
| **Recurring** | `stay_fresh.sh` | Weekly / on demand | Caches, Homebrew, Docker, Xcode, toolchains |
| **Legacy** | `v1_stay_fresh.sh` | On demand | Minimal subset of the above; no flags |

The two bootstrap scripts are independent — you can run either one
first. `stay_fresh.sh` assumes Homebrew is installed but degrades
gracefully if optional tools (Docker, `mise`, `gcloud`, etc.) are
missing.

## Design principles

These are the invariants every script upholds. They explain why the
code looks the way it does.

| Principle | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| **Idempotent** | Re-running a script upgrades in place. No duplicate installs, no appended shell-rc blocks, no runaway cache. |
| **Fail-soft** | One failing step never aborts the rest of the run. Missing tools are skipped with a note, not treated as errors. |
| **Dry-run first** | `--dry-run` is supported on every script that mutates state (except the explicitly minimal `v1_stay_fresh.sh`). No `sudo` prompt is triggered in dry-run. |
| **Logged** | Every non-trivial script writes a timestamped log to `$TMPDIR`. `--verbose` also streams to the terminal. |
| **No hidden writes** | Shell rc files are modified only when you pass `--setup-shell`. Every such block is bracketed by markers so it can be found and removed. |
| **Opt-out, not opt-in** | `stay_fresh.sh` has a skip flag for every step. `install_apps.sh` honors `--only`/`--skip` for casks, `--skip-cli-ops` / `--skip-formulae` for CLI brew packages, and gcloud component flags. |
| **Sudo only when needed** | Scripts request `sudo` once at startup, keep it warm for the run, and release it on exit. Running as `root` is refused. |

## Requirements

- macOS 12 (Monterey) or newer, on Apple Silicon or Intel.
- Administrator password for a single interactive `sudo` prompt (used
  by `purge` and by Homebrew installs where applicable).
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- At least 5 GB of free disk space on `/`.
- An active internet connection to `formulae.brew.sh` and GitHub.

`install_apps.sh` installs Homebrew automatically if it is missing.
The other scripts assume Homebrew is already on `PATH` — run
`install_apps.sh` first on a fresh machine, or install Homebrew
manually from <https://brew.sh>.

## Quick start

On a fresh machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greenblacked/pretty-usuful-scripts.git
cd pretty-usuful-scripts/macos-initial-setup

./install_apps.sh     --dry-run --verbose
./install_devtools.sh --dry-run --verbose

./install_apps.sh                        # 1. cask apps + DevOps CLIs + Google Cloud SDK
./install_devtools.sh --setup-shell      # 2. language toolchains

ln -sfn "$PWD/zsh_aliases.zsh" "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh"
grep -qsF '.zsh_aliases.zsh' ~/.zshrc \
  || echo '[[ -f "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh"' \
       >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh                                 # 3. reload shell with aliases + shims
```

The preflight output of `install_apps.sh` looks like this on a healthy
machine:

```text
=== install_apps: preflight checks ===
[info] log file: /tmp/install_apps-20260421-093014.log
[ok  ] macOS 14.5 (23F79) on arm64
[ok  ] bash 3.2.57(1)-release
[ok  ] running as user: szolotov
[ok  ] internet reachable (formulae.brew.sh)
[ok  ] Xcode Command Line Tools: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
[ok  ] free disk space: 184G on /
[ok  ] Homebrew 4.3.8 (prefix: /opt/homebrew)
```

If any preflight check fails, the script exits with code `2` and
prints a pointed message explaining what to fix.

## `install_apps.sh`

Installs desktop applications via Homebrew **Cask**, a batch of **CLI
formulae** for Kubernetes and platform work (including **`k9s`**), then
the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud-cli`) with common components. Cask apps
already present in `/Applications` but not managed by Homebrew are
**adopted** (`brew install --cask --force`) so that future upgrades flow
through `brew` instead of each vendor's auto-updater.

### Usage

```bash
./install_apps.sh                        # full install (interactive)
./install_apps.sh --dry-run --verbose    # preview and stream details
./install_apps.sh --yes                  # non-interactive
```

### Options

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Show the plan; change nothing. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Stream `brew` output live (also runs `brew doctor` into the log). |
| `--only a,b,c` | Install only the listed casks. |
| `--skip a,b,c` | Install everything except the listed casks. |
| `--skip-upgrade` | Do not upgrade already-installed casks or formulae. |
| `--no-cleanup` | Skip `brew cleanup` at the end of the run. |
| `--skip-gcloud` | Omit the Google Cloud SDK entirely. |
| `--skip-cli-ops` | Skip the entire Homebrew **formula** batch (see below). |
| `--skip-formulae a,b,c` | Skip individual formula names (comma-separated). |
| `--gcloud-components a,b,c` | Override the default component set. |
| `--no-gcloud-components` | Install `gcloud` core only (no components). |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the built-in help (lists every cask and formula). |

### Bundled cask applications

**General use:** `brave-browser`, `visual-studio-code`, `cursor`,
`orbstack`, `slack`, `zoom`, `telegram`, `spotify`.

**DevOps and platform engineering (GUI):** `iterm2`, `raycast`, `github`,
`lens`, `postman`, `drawio`, `wireshark-app`, `dbeaver-community`,
`google-chrome`, `1password`, `microsoft-teams`, `notion`, `tailscale-app`,
`cloudflare-warp`, `ngrok`, `rectangle`, `alt-tab`, `maccy`, `zed`,
`sublime-text`, `jetbrains-toolbox`, `fork`, `gitkraken`,
`azure-data-studio`, `postico`, `redisinsight`, `cyberduck`, `proxyman`,
`linear-linear`, `discord`.

Pass `--skip a,b,c` to omit casks your organization provisions elsewhere.
The `ngrok` cask installs a **binary only** (no `.app`).

### Bundled CLI formulae (`brew install`)

Installed after the cask loop unless you pass `--skip-cli-ops`. Includes
**`k9s`**, **`stern`**, **`kubectx`**, **`kind`**, **`minikube`**, **`skaffold`**,
**`kustomize`**, **`helm`**, **`helmfile`**, **`krew`**, **`eksctl`**, **`argocd`**,
**`velero`**, **`cilium-cli`**, **`awscli`**, **`azure-cli`**, **`grpcurl`**,
**`terraform-docs`**, **`tflint`**, **`terragrunt`**, **`infracost`**, **`conftest`**,
**`opa`**, **`cosign`**, **`crane`**, **`dive`**, **`lazydocker`**, **`popeye`**,
**`kubescape`**, **`grype`**, **`trivy`**, **`jq`**, **`yq`**, **`httpie`**, **`hey`**,
**`vegeta`**.

Homebrew's core formula named **`flux`** is the Influx query language, not
Flux CD; for the Flux CD CLI use `brew install fluxcd/tap/flux` separately if
you need it. **`helm`** is also installed by `install_devtools.sh` — running
both scripts is safe (idempotent).

### Google Cloud SDK components

By default the script installs `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` and `kubectl`.
It prefers `brew install <component>` and falls back to
`gcloud components install <component>` when the component is not
packaged as a Homebrew formula.

```bash
./install_apps.sh --gcloud-components gke-gcloud-auth-plugin,kubectl,beta
./install_apps.sh --no-gcloud-components
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Completed successfully. |
| `1` | One or more installs failed. |
| `2` | Preflight checks failed. |
| `3` | Invalid arguments. |

---

## `install_devtools.sh`

Installs developer toolchains using version managers so that multiple
versions can coexist on the same machine. The script requires Homebrew —
run `install_apps.sh` first on a fresh machine, or install Homebrew
manually.

### Which manager should I pick?

| `--manager` | Best for | Installs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` *(default)* | Maximum ecosystem fidelity — each tool uses its canonical version manager. | `pyenv` + `tfenv` + `goenv` + Homebrew `helm` |
| `tenv` | Teams that also need OpenTofu or Terragrunt alongside Terraform. | `pyenv` + `tenv` + `goenv` + Homebrew `helm` |
| `mise` | A single binary for all language runtimes; fastest switching. | `mise` (Python, Terraform, Go) + Homebrew `helm` |

If you are unsure, `native` is the safest choice: each tool behaves
exactly as its upstream documentation expects.

### Usage

```bash
./install_devtools.sh                      # native managers, latest versions (interactive)
./install_devtools.sh --dry-run            # preview changes
./install_devtools.sh --yes --setup-shell  # non-interactive; wire ~/.zshrc
```

### Options

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Show the plan; change nothing. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Stream `brew`, `pyenv`, and builder output live. |
| `--setup-shell` | Append initialization lines to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`. |
| `--manager native\|tenv\|mise` | Select a manager stack (default: `native`). |
| `--python-version V` | Pin Python (default: latest stable 3.x). |
| `--terraform-version V` | Pin Terraform (default: latest). |
| `--go-version V` | Pin Go (default: latest). |
| `--helm-version V` | Pin Helm (default: latest from Homebrew). |
| `--skip-python` | Do not install Python. |
| `--skip-terraform` | Do not install Terraform. |
| `--skip-go` | Do not install Go. |
| `--skip-helm` | Do not install Helm. |
| `--helm-plugins a,b,c` | Override the plugin set (default: `helm-diff`). |
| `--no-helm-plugins` | Do not install any Helm plugins. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the built-in help. |

Known Helm plugin shorthands (`helm-diff`, `helm-secrets`, `helm-git`)
resolve to their canonical Git URLs; full `https://…` URLs are also
accepted.

### Shell configuration

With `--setup-shell`, the script appends the required initialization
lines to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`). Each block is bracketed by a
marker comment so re-running is idempotent and the block can be located
and removed by hand:

- `pyenv init` + `pyenv virtualenv-init`
- `goenv init`
- `tenv` PATH shims (not needed for `tfenv`, which lives under
  `$(brew --prefix)/bin`)
- `eval "$(mise activate <shell>)"` when `--manager mise` is used

Without `--setup-shell`, the script prints the exact block to copy into
your shell configuration yourself.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Completed successfully. |
| `1` | One or more installs failed. |
| `2` | Preflight checks failed. |
| `3` | Invalid arguments. |

## `stay_fresh.sh`

End-to-end macOS housekeeping. Each step is independent, measures the
disk space freed, and degrades gracefully when a tool is missing or a
path is protected by System Integrity Protection.

### Steps

1. Purge inactive memory (`sudo purge`).
2. Flush the DNS cache (`dscacheutil`, `mDNSResponder`).
3. Clear system caches (`/Library/Caches` and writable entries under
   `/System/Library/Caches`).
4. Clear user caches (`~/Library/Caches`, Logs, Saved State, Xcode
   DerivedData, and related paths).
5. Empty `~/.Trash`.
6. Clean developer-tool caches (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pip`, `gem`,
   `go`, `cargo`).
7. Prune Docker / OrbStack (images, containers, volumes, builder
   cache).
8. Clean Xcode extras (Archives, DeviceSupport, obsolete simulators).
9. Remove diagnostic and crash reports (user and system).
10. Update and upgrade Homebrew (formulae and casks), run `cleanup` and
    `autoremove`.
11. Run `mise self-update`, update plugins, and upgrade tools.
12. Update installed Helm plugins.
13. Run `gcloud components update`.
14. Report active versions of `pyenv`, `goenv`, `tfenv`, `tenv`, `helm`,
    and `gcloud`.

### Usage

```bash
./stay_fresh.sh                   # interactive, full run
./stay_fresh.sh --dry-run         # preview the plan
./stay_fresh.sh --yes --verbose   # non-interactive; stream output live
./stay_fresh.sh --brew-greedy     # also upgrade :latest / auto_updates casks
./stay_fresh.sh --no-sudo         # skip every step that requires sudo
./stay_fresh.sh --skip-devtools   # skip all dev-tool refresh steps at once
```

### Options

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Show the plan; change nothing. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompts. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Stream per-step output live. |
| `--no-sudo` | Skip `purge`, DNS flush, system caches, and system diagnostics. |
| `--brew-greedy` | Upgrade casks that self-update (`auto_updates true`, `:latest`). |
| `--skip-devtools` | Shorthand for `--skip-mise --skip-helm-plugins --skip-gcloud --skip-versions`. |
| `--skip-memory` | Skip the `sudo purge` step. |
| `--skip-dns` | Skip the DNS cache flush. |
| `--skip-syscaches` | Skip system-cache cleanup. |
| `--skip-usercaches` | Skip user-cache cleanup. |
| `--skip-trash` | Skip emptying `~/.Trash`. |
| `--skip-brew` | Skip Homebrew update/upgrade/cleanup. |
| `--skip-devcaches` | Skip `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm`/`pip`/`gem`/`go`/`cargo` cache cleanup. |
| `--skip-docker` | Skip Docker / OrbStack prune. |
| `--skip-xcode` | Skip Xcode extras cleanup. |
| `--skip-diagnostics` | Skip diagnostic and crash-report cleanup. |
| `--skip-mise` | Skip `mise` update. |
| `--skip-helm-plugins` | Skip Helm plugin updates. |
| `--skip-gcloud` | Skip `gcloud components update`. |
| `--skip-versions` | Skip the final version report. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the built-in help. |

### Output

The script prints a per-step plan, runs each step with OK / WARN / FAIL
accounting, and closes with a summary that includes:

- Elapsed wall-clock time.
- `df` delta on `/`.
- Sum of per-step deltas (more precise than `df` alone).
- Which steps passed, warned, were skipped, or failed.
- Path to the full log file.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Completed (possibly with warnings). |
| `1` | One or more steps hard-failed. |
| `2` | Preflight checks failed. |
| `3` | Invalid arguments. |

---

## `v1_stay_fresh.sh`

The original housekeeping sequence (previously shipped as
`old_stay_fresh.sh`), preserved for users who prefer the simpler flow.
It has been modernized to run stand-alone: there is no dependency on
`~/scripts/functions`, and the `step`/`next`/`try` reporting helpers are
inlined. Prefer `stay_fresh.sh` unless you specifically need this
minimal runner.

### Steps

1. Refresh Quick Look and Finder caches.
2. Purge inactive memory (`sudo purge`).
3. Clear history leftovers (`~/.lesshst`, `~/.mysql_history`).
4. Clear user caches (`~/Library/Caches`, Xcode Archives and
   DerivedData, `composer clearcache`).
5. Update Homebrew taps.
6. Upgrade Homebrew formulae.
7. Clean Homebrew caches (`brew cleanup --prune=3 -s`, remove
   `brew --cache`, `brew tap --repair`).
8. Update Terraform via `tfenv`.
9. Update Helm via the upstream `get-helm-3` installer.
10. Update Python via `pyenv` (3.x only).
11. Update Go via `gvm`.
12. Run `gcloud components update`.
13. Print the AWS CLI version.
14. Print free space on `/`.

The invoking user's home directory is resolved via `dscl` (using
`$SUDO_USER` or `id -un`), so cache paths still target the correct user
when the script is launched from a sanitized environment such as `sudo`
or `launchd`.

### Usage

```bash
./v1_stay_fresh.sh              # prompts once for sudo, then runs everything
./v1_stay_fresh.sh --help       # show the built-in help
```

The complete flag surface is `-h` / `--help`. There is no `--dry-run`,
`--yes`, `--no-sudo`, or skip flag — use `stay_fresh.sh` if any of those
are required. A failing step never aborts the remainder of the run.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Completed normally, including `--help`. Per-step failures are reported in the output but do not change this. |
| `1` | Bootstrap failure: cannot determine a usable home directory. |
| `2` | Invalid arguments. |

If you need hard-fail semantics on per-step failures, use
`stay_fresh.sh` instead.

---

## `zsh_aliases.zsh`

A curated set of zsh aliases and helper functions. Every optional
dependency (`eza`, `bat`, `fd`, `rg`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `helm`,
`terraform`, `pyenv`, `goenv`, and so on) is guarded behind
`command -v`, so the file is safe to source on any machine regardless
of which tools are installed.

### Installation

```bash
ln -sfn "$PWD/zsh_aliases.zsh" "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh"
grep -qsF '.zsh_aliases.zsh' ~/.zshrc \
  || echo '[[ -f "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh" ]] && source "$HOME/.zsh_aliases.zsh"' \
       >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
```

Re-running the block is safe: `ln -sfn` overwrites the symlink in place,
and the `grep` guard ensures the `source` line is appended to `~/.zshrc`
only once.

### What you get

| Category | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Safety | `cp`, `mv`, `rm` default to `-i` (use `\rm` to bypass). |
| Navigation | `..`, `...`, `....`, `.....`, `-`, `~`, `mkcd`, `up N`. |
| Listing | `ls`, `l`, `ll`, `la`, `lt` prefer `eza` when available. |
| Modern replacements | `cat`→`bat`, `find`→`fd`, `grep`→`rg`, `top`→`htop`, `df`→`duf`, `du`→`dust`. |
| Git | `gs`, `gaa`, `gcm`, `gco`, `gcb`, `gp`, `gpl`, `gl`, plus `gwip` (stage + checkpoint) and `gprune` (delete merged branches). |
| Docker / Compose | `d`, `dps`, `dprune`, `dc`, `dcu`, `dcd`, `dcl`. |
| Kubernetes | `k`, `kg`, `kd`, `kl`, `kx`, `kns`. |
| Homebrew | `brewup` (`update` + `upgrade --greedy` + `cleanup` + `autoremove`). |
| Python | Auto-inits `pyenv` + `pyenv-virtualenv`; `venv` creates and activates a local `.venv`. |
| Go | Auto-inits `goenv`, adds `$GOPATH/bin` to `PATH`; `gor`, `gob`, `got`. |
| Terraform / OpenTofu / Helm | `tf*`, `to*`, `h*` shortcuts. |
| Script shortcuts | `stay-fresh`, `install-apps`, `install-devtools` when the scripts are present next to this file. |
| macOS helpers | `flushdns`, `purgemem`, `showfiles`/`hidefiles`, `lock`, `ejectall`, `localip`, `myip`, `pbj`. |
| Functions | `mkcd`, `extract`, `up N`, `mkbackup`, `weather [city]`. |

The `_ZSH_ALIASES_DIR` variable resolves the directory of this file, so
the script shortcuts keep working regardless of where the repository is
cloned. The file is designed to be read top to bottom — comment out
anything you do not want, or append your own additions at the end.

## What this changes on your machine

A plain-language audit trail of every side effect, grouped by the
script responsible. Everything below is reversible with standard
Homebrew / `pyenv` / `goenv` commands.

### `install_apps.sh`

- Installs Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local`
  (Intel) if it is missing.
- Installs the casks listed under *Bundled applications*; existing
  unmanaged apps in `/Applications` are adopted into Homebrew.
- Installs the `gcloud-cli` cask and the components listed with
  `--gcloud-components`.
- Writes `/tmp/install_apps-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`.
- Runs `brew cleanup` at the end unless `--no-cleanup` is passed.
- Does **not** modify any shell configuration files.

### `install_devtools.sh`

- Installs the selected version manager(s): `pyenv`,
  `pyenv-virtualenv`, `tfenv` or `tenv`, `goenv`, and/or `mise` via
  Homebrew.
- Installs Python build dependencies:
  `openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk`.
- Installs the pinned (or latest) versions of Python, Terraform, Go,
  and Helm under each manager's usual directory (`~/.pyenv`,
  `~/.goenv`, `$(brew --prefix)/bin`).
- Installs the configured Helm plugins (default: `helm-diff`).
- Appends one bracketed block per tool to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`
  **only when `--setup-shell` is passed**. Each block is marked so it
  can be located and removed by hand.
- Writes `/tmp/install_devtools-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`.

### `stay_fresh.sh`

- Deletes cache contents (not the directories themselves) under
  `/Library/Caches`, writable entries of `/System/Library/Caches`,
  `~/Library/Caches`, Logs, Saved State, Xcode DerivedData, and related
  paths.
- Empties `~/.Trash`.
- Clears developer-tool caches (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pip`, `gem`,
  `go`, `cargo`).
- Runs `docker system prune -af --volumes` equivalents and `brew
  cleanup`/`autoremove` where applicable.
- Upgrades Homebrew formulae and casks (greedy upgrade only with
  `--brew-greedy`).
- Updates `mise`, Helm plugins, and `gcloud` components when those
  tools are installed.
- Writes `/tmp/stay_fresh-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`.
- Does **not** modify any shell configuration files.

### `v1_stay_fresh.sh`

- Runs the subset of cleanup and toolchain updates listed in its
  *Steps* section.
- Deletes `~/.lesshst` and `~/.mysql_history` if present.
- Writes no log file by default; redirect yourself with `tee` if a
  transcript is needed:

  ```bash
  ./v1_stay_fresh.sh 2>&1 | tee /tmp/v1_stay_fresh.log
  ```

### `zsh_aliases.zsh`

- Affects interactive shells only. Sourcing the file adds aliases and
  functions to the current shell; it does not write anything to disk
  and does not modify system files.

### Privileged operations

The three top-level scripts request `sudo` only for the operations
below. They refuse to run as `root`, prompt once at the start, and
release the credential on exit.

| Script | Uses `sudo` for |
| --- | --- |
| `install_apps.sh` | Cask installs that require admin approval (Homebrew invokes `sudo` internally; the script itself does not escalate). |
| `install_devtools.sh` | Same as above, only via Homebrew where required. |
| `stay_fresh.sh` | `purge`, DNS flush, `/Library/Caches` cleanup, system diagnostic cleanup. Pass `--no-sudo` to skip all of these. |
| `v1_stay_fresh.sh` | `purge`. No way to opt out — use `stay_fresh.sh --no-sudo` instead. |
